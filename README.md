# JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description 

This week's Challenge we modify starter code to create an application that enables users to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected (Uppercase, Lowercase,Number, Special Characters ). This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. 

## Install
